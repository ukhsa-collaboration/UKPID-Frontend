# Styling

## Colours

Need a colour that isn't already provided by the Fluent UI packages? Double check that it (or something close enough) isn't already provided.

If it isn't, check if you actually need the colour. For example, it's not standard in Fluent UI to have a red coloured button to denote danger. Instead, you should opt for whatever Fluent UI recommends.

If you do need to add a new colour, do it via Design Tokens in the `renderer/fluent.js` file.

## Potentially useful resources

- [Fluent UI React v9 Colors](https://react.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/theme-colors--page) - we're not using react, but this is somewhat useful for finding Fluent UI colors that may or may not be provided by the packages installed on this project.
- [Windows UI Kit](<https://www.figma.com/file/8kL9LgOnH229ztiYauJxSN/Windows-UI-3-(Community)?type=design&node-id=2434-129659&mode=design&t=vaJH7cA76bP9ZOlC-0>) - useful for reference
- [WinUI 3 Gallery App](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/winui-3-gallery/9P3JFPWWDZRC?gl=&hl=) - very useful reference tool to see all Fluent UI controls and patterns.
